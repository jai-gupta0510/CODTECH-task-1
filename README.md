OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

PROJECT: LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (Task 1)

Objective

The objective is to develop a database system that:

Catalogs Books: Stores detailed information about each book in the library.
Tracks Book Availability: Manages the number of copies available for each book.
Supports Queries: Allows for efficient retrieval of book information based on various criteria.
Key Components

Database Design:

Tables: Define the tables needed to store information about books, and potentially other related entities like authors or genres.
Relationships: Establish relationships between different entities to ensure data integrity and consistency.

SQL Commands:

Create: Define the schema of the database, including tables and their attributes.
Insert: Add new records to the database.
Update: Modify existing records.
Delete: Remove records from the database.
Select: Retrieve information based on specific queries.
Database Schema
The primary table for managing book inventory is the Books table. Here’s a basic schema:

Books Table:
BookID: Unique identifier for each book (Primary Key).
Title: Title of the book.
Author: Author of the book.
Genre: Genre of the book.
PublishedYear: Year the book was published.
ISBN: International Standard Book Number.
CopiesAvailable: Number of copies of the book currently available in the library.

Considerations:

Normalization: Ensure the database is normalized to avoid redundancy and maintain data integrity. For example, if the database grows, you might need additional tables for authors or genres.

Indexes: Adding indexes on frequently queried columns (e.g., ISBN, Author) can improve query performance.

Scalability: Design the database with future scalability in mind. As the library’s inventory grows, the database should be able to handle increased data volume efficiently.

Security: Implement access controls and backup procedures to protect the data and ensure its availability.

User Interface: While not part of the database design itself, consider how users (librarians, staff) will interact with the database. A user-friendly interface or integrated application can facilitate easier management and access to book information.
